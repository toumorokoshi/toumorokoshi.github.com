        <p>I’m reflecting on my personal time during 2024. A lot of my time was spent
working on things with my family that I won’t share here, but nontheless I did
make some progress with my personal goals.</p>
                <h2 id="farsi">   Farsi <a href="#farsi">#</a>   </h2>
                    

<p>This year, I think my Farsi has gotten quite a bit better:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Conversationally I can express most things.</li>
  <li>I can watch some Farsi TV and news and get the general idea.</li>
</ul>

<p>The only video game with a Farsi translation I found is <a href="https://childrenofmorta.com/">Children of
Morta</a>: I guess one of the developers is Iranian
and wanted to get a Farsi translation in. I’m super thankful for that, so I can watch those cutscenes a few times and learn the Farsi from there.</p>

<p>The big thing I did is start listening to TV in the car regularly: it’s a good
way to reinforce my listening abilities.</p>

<p>I still take Farsi lessons weekly. For 2025, I think I’ll continue at this pace,
and loosely target being able to listen and understand Farsi TV.</p>
                <h2 id="fitness-and-health">   Fitness and Health <a href="#fitness-and-health">#</a>   </h2>
                    

<p>I’ve continued working on fitness this year. Primarily lowering body fat,
building muscle, and lowering my apob.</p>

<p>I haven’t taken a Dexa scan since July, but my body fat actually went up at the
time compared to January: I think it was due to a two-week long trip I took to
Japan in June. I was not able to work out at all, and also walked a significant
amount of time so I was still, somewhat, in a caloric deficit.</p>

<p>That said, my weight at the end of the year is about 174 pounds. Losing roughly
4 pounds in the first half of the year to 176, and 2 pounds in the last half.
I’m not sure where my body fat is at, but likely 13% where it stood in July.</p>

<p>Interestingly I lost muscle mass across the board except for my stomach in July.
I still need to check to see if I was able to regain it or not.</p>

<p>I’ve found a good routine for a caloric deficit and overall weight loss, which
is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>400 calories daily burned at the treadmill (walking 30 minutes at 3.5mph, at a
12 degree incline).</li>
  <li>A 30 minute weightlifting workout, mixing in some crossfit-style workouts from
time to time to do some interval training.</li>
  <li>Maintaining ~1400 calories a day.</li>
</ul>

<p>I cheat on the calories regularly, so my weight is yo-yoing for now, but I’m
able to keep it between 171 and 175, and able to lose a pound a week with the
above. Given the holidays, I think this is invitable, but hoping to get back on
the wagon next year.</p>

<p>I upped my protein to 1.6g protein / kg, which I’ve read is about where the
benefits to hypertrophy level off.</p>

<p>For 2025, with a consistent technique to lose weight, I’m shifting my focus to
figure out how to build more muscle. I think there’s a lot of optimization I’m
missing out on there.</p>
                <h2 id="japanese">   Japanese <a href="#japanese">#</a>   </h2>
                    

<p>For this year, my Japanese took a back burner. I stopped taking regular Japanese
lessons. Honestly I think to maximize those lessons, I would have to start doing
some pretty complex assignments like writing of papers and whatnot. It’s not
something I’m that interested in investing time into.</p>

<p>For now, I’ll just play video games in Japanese when I can. I have Witcher 3 and
the Tactics Ogre remake, which will be dozens of hours and are already
challenging me with new vocabulary.</p>
                <h2 id="oss-aepdev">   OSS: aep.dev <a href="#oss-aepdev">#</a>   </h2>
                    

<p>aep.dev made a ton of progress! Don’t just take my word for it -  check out our
<a href="https://aep.dev/blog/2024-in-review/">public blog post</a> on the topic.</p>

<p>I’m very proud of the fact that we finally moved from just theoretical benefits
to the client tooling, to real UIs and clients. If you author an AEP-compliant
specification, you can get a <a href="https://github.com/aep-dev/aepcli">command line for
free</a>. We’re working on a web
<a href="https://github.com/aep-dev/aep-explorer">UI</a>, and have some prototyping of a
Terraform/OpenTofu provider as well.</p>

<p>With the progress we’ve made this year, I’m very excited about using that as a
foundation for continued progress in aep.dev in 2025. This could be the year we
really build out a full offering, and provide something compelling to adopters
of our API specification!</p>
                <h2 id="goals-for-2025">   Goals for 2025 <a href="#goals-for-2025">#</a>   </h2>
                    

<p>For 2025, my goals are still to primarily have ample time to do impromptu things
with my family. But I do have a few goals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Get a roadmap for aep.dev</li>
  <li>Play piano 10 minutes a day. Last year, I did not learn new 5 piano pieces.
Darn! But I’ll make this my new goal for the year. My goal this year is to be
able to play piano pieces from just reading sheet music.</li>
  <li>Be able to understand persian news.</li>
  <li>Achieve 11% body fat, without losing muscle mass.</li>
</ul>
