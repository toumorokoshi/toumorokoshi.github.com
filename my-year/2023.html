        <p>Another year, another reflection to summarize 1%+ of my life.</p>
                <h2 id="japanese">   Japanese <a href="#japanese">#</a>   </h2>
                    

<p>I think my Japanese has reached a plateau, but it’s something I’m comfortable
with for now. The biggest gap is in my vocabulary - I’m still looking up words
in a dictionary every page I read a book or a more mature manga.</p>

<p>But whenever I play video games, I do it in Japanese! That’s a pretty good
benchmark for me, and helps me keep practicing my Japanese aside from my weekly
30 minutes lessons.</p>
                <h2 id="farsi">   Farsi <a href="#farsi">#</a>   </h2>
                    

<p>My Farsi has not developed significantly since last year. I’m just on a slow,
steady trajectory of reading one page at a time.</p>

<p>I did pick up one of the stories I read last year and tried it again, and I was
able to get through most of it by myself! In addition, I am able to have <em>some</em>
conversation with my in-laws. So despite the relatively slow progress I’m making
<em>sufficient</em> progress to be satisfied.</p>

<p>Next year though, I’d like to invest more in my Farsi - get to the point where I
can read a good chunk of literature without help from my teacher.</p>
                <h2 id="fitness-and-health">   Fitness and Health <a href="#fitness-and-health">#</a>   </h2>
                    

<p>I focused heavily on fitness this year, similar to the tail end of last year.</p>

<p>I have yet to do my Dexa scan for end of 2023, but I sit at roughly 180lbs. My
Dexa scan in April showed I had lost 12 pounds of body fat and gained 6 pounds
of muscle since October 2022 - not bad at all for six months!</p>

<p>My second half of the year wasn’t as aggressive - I lost 2 pounds, hopefully fat
but January we will see.</p>

<p>It’s been grueling to get there - my diet now consists of one proper meal a day
(dinner), with protein and huel shakes in between to provide 80 grams of
protein. Between that and soy lattes, I get at minimum 90 grams of protein
before dinner or snacks. That’s putting me at roughly 1.2+ g protein / kg of
body weight, which is less than what most recommend for building muscle mass,
but I haven’t seen much of an issue.</p>

<p>Next year my goal is to stick my diet a bit more, and achieve 12% body fat or
less. Once that happens I think I’ll try to maintain my weight and start
focusing on other things.</p>
                <h2 id="zone-2-on-the-treadmill">   Zone 2 on the treadmill <a href="#zone-2-on-the-treadmill">#</a>   </h2>
                    

<p>I’ve been struggling to get more Zone 2 exercise into my routine - basically 30+
minutes of my heart rate at 70%-80% of my max heart rate.</p>

<p>This year I found something that works for me - playing videogames on the
treadmill!</p>

<p>I’ve been playing an RPG that keeps me engaged - Persona 4 has worked really
well for me. It also helps that it’s a long RPG, with 100+ hours to beat it.</p>

<p>With that I’ve been able to clear 30 minutes at a 12% incline and 4 miles per
hour without issue, although I don’t get past 45 very often (too late at night
or just get tired of it).</p>
                <h2 id="oss-contributions">   OSS Contributions <a href="#oss-contributions">#</a>   </h2>
                    

<p>Since I’ve left Google as TL of API design, I’ve been working on a fork called
https://aep.dev/. It’s been an interesting ride, discussing API design with API
leads at Roblox, IBM, Netflix, and Microsoft.</p>

<p>I built a prototype protobuf generator as part of my work, which was a fun
coding side project. Hopefully in 2024 we’ll see more established and some parts
of the spec entering production use.</p>
                <h2 id="random-other-things">   Random other things <a href="#random-other-things">#</a>   </h2>
                    

<ul>
  <li>My vscode PR was completed by someone else! <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/6966">awesome, this means I can finally
translate my emacs keybindings
over</a>.</li>
</ul>
                <h2 id="goals-for-2024">   Goals for 2024 <a href="#goals-for-2024">#</a>   </h2>
                    

<p>Similar to 2023, my 2024 goals are conservative - I’d like to focus on my family
and that means all of my afternoons and a good chunk of my evenings are working
on things relative to them.</p>

<p>But among my goals, they are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Be able to read a Farsi book and understand most of the story (a movie may be
too hard for me).</li>
  <li>Learn to play 5 new pieces on the piano.</li>
  <li>Built a foundational knowledge of machine learning and abstract math.</li>
</ul>
