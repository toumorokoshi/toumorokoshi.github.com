<p>Recently, I needed to help plan a project that spanned across dozens of teams,
as wel as product areas and VPs. My task was planning my team’s deliverables,
but to do so, there were multiple pieces of information that one had to consider,
including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Estimates on the work my team would perform.</li>
  <li>Timelines of our dependencies, and the dependencies of my team’s dependencies.</li>
  <li>Relationships between these dependencies.</li>
  <li>Stack ranking based on business impact.</li>
</ul>

<p>The process was quite taxing, resulting in quarterly planning where we had to
dig up all the context from previous quarters, find outdated docs, and go
through a multi-day effort to get this information presentable to the senior
leadership team.</p>

<p>From that, I’ve been working on some patterns and processes, built on our
existing project management tooling, make it easier to produce these roadmaps
and extract information.</p>

<h2 id="these-patterns-work-in-most-issue-trackers">These patterns work in most issue trackers</h2>

<p>I left this blog post conceptual intentionally: it’s because these are <em>design
patterns</em>: ideas that can, for the most part, be applied to any issue tracking
tool (Jira, Smartsheet, an in-house tracker).</p>

<p>Although a custom tracker may be written for this purpose, I think that these
ideas are actually more useful as design patterns. Organizations almost always
have decided on their project tracker of choice, and it’s impractical, if not
infeasible, to replace that with a bespoke solution.</p>

<p>It’s much simpler to layer these patterns on top of existing trackers, allowing
this project structure to leverage the knowledge in the issue tracker, rather
than duplicating it.</p>

<h2 id="the-patterns">The Patterns</h2>

<h3 id="a-structured-graph-of-tasks">A structured graph of tasks</h3>

<p>I’ve seen attempts to manage large project planning in long-form documents, but
once execution has begun, the individual projects and dependencies themselves
are best off in a data structure: in particular, it should be possible to
represent the tasks themselves as nodes in an acyclic graph.</p>

<p>This type of structure allows for multiple use cases, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Attaching common metadata to each node (like acceptance criteria, business impact).</li>
  <li>Extracting the delivery date of a node based on the delivery dates of parent
nodes, and including the effort estimate of the current one.</li>
  <li>Visualization (e.g. gantt or graph style), helping one see what the real
dependencies are.</li>
  <li>Traversing the graph to find issues that apply to a particular category (team,
org, product area)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="tagging-over-hierarchical-structure">Tagging over hierarchical structure</h3>

<p>Although it’s common to enforce a hierarchical structure on data (e.g. issues by
team), I think tagging (e.g. Jira labels) ends up being a more useful approach.</p>

<p>Especially with tasks, there are so many different consumers that choosing a
single structure certainly will not work for all of them. Consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The individual contributor who just wants to look at their issues, and maybe
their teams.</li>
  <li>The manager who wants to look at all projects for their team.</li>
  <li>The director, who wants to look at projects for their team, and possibly
others that they depend on.</li>
  <li>The project manager, who wants to see all tasks that pertain to their project,
regardless of the individual or team executing that task.</li>
</ul>

<p>This, combined with products moving teams and teams moving organizations,
creates change that makes organizational hierarchy at minimum a brittle choice.</p>

<p>With tagging, along with a convention around those, it should be very easy to
create new roadmaps (just add a new tag to all relevant issues), add one-off
issues to a view for the team or organization.</p>

<h3 id="spreadsheets-for-easy-editing">Spreadsheets for easy editing</h3>

<p>At Google, we had a giant table for bugs (likely implemented as multiple tables with foreign keys for custom fields) called buganizer. You can see a glimpse of what it looks like at https://issuetracker.google.com/issues.</p>

<p>A developer wrote a tool that would do a bidirectional sync to a Google sheet,
thereby allowing us to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Easily review the data and fields in a data dense format.</li>
  <li>Visualize roadmaps</li>
  <li>Copy-paste the spreadsheet content into documents or presentations with
leadership.</li>
  <li>Modify the fields quickly for project planning.</li>
  <li>Add new issues as we found dependencies or tasks missing.</li>
</ol>

<p>This tool was absolutely amazing - it overcame the friction of mass
modification and at-a-glance visualization.</p>

<h3 id="metadata-to-attach-a-node">Metadata to attach a node</h3>

<p>This is not a design pattern per se, but there are often specific fields in
projects that I’ve found to be very useful in roadmapping discussions. Those
are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The business impact of the milestone: senior leadership will often ask about
the cost-benefit of lowering the priority of specific tasks, and it’s helpful
to understand why this is valuable.</li>
  <li>Acceptance criteria: a good practice regardless of this post, but it’s
valuable to be crystal clear on <em>what</em> you’re planning on delivering, and how
to validate it has been delivered. It often discovers gaps in understanding or
expectations.</li>
  <li>A target delivery date: if there is a hard due date, it’s valuable to specify
that.</li>
  <li>An effort or wall time estimate, in a unit of time: this helps you calculate
the actual time it would take to deliver something, based on the target date
of a tasks’s dependencies.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="specify-a-target-date-or-calculate-based-on-dependencies">Specify a target date, or calculate based on dependencies.</h3>

<p>A big issue with cross-organizational planning is figuring out how long it will
actually take to deliver something. In an ideal model, the actual delivery
date of something is the sum of the duration of current task, and the sum or the
delivery dates of all of the upstream dependencies that will take the longest.</p>

<p>Therefore, two pieces of information are necessary to calculate such a date:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The duration of the actual task (also known as effort, cost, or other names).</li>
  <li>The estimated delivery date. for example, an external dependency on a vendor,
or hardware with target date at which it will finish being constructed. These
commitments are generally dates, not based on some effort estimate.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="make-project-trackers-fast">Make project trackers fast</h3>

<p>The biggest killer to project management trackers is the speed or friction it
takes to update them. If changing a single field requires five steps, or a page
load takes a long time, those will both completely disincentivize people to fill
things in as they go. Speed is a common reason I’ve heard, discussing the ideas
in this blog post with colleagues.</p>

<p>Due to similar friction I’ve faced with documents anod knowledge bases, I just
keep a bunch of markdown document in a folder for my notes. I opened it with
VSCode so I can easily jot down notes - this is vastly faster than any web-based
solution I’ve found, and I’m more likely to take good notes as a result.</p>

<h2 id="existing-challenges">Existing Challenges</h2>

<p>These patterns above provide a great structure for organizing this knowledge.
However, this alone is not a complete solution for a well organized project.</p>

<p>I’ve enumerated some of the challenges below.</p>

<h3 id="keeping-task-metadata-up-to-date">Keeping task metadata up to date</h3>

<p>Like any semi-automated system, the above is only valuable if the data is up to
date. In my experience, individual contributors like doing the work, but do not
like rotely filling in updates in project trackers.</p>

<p>Some patterns I’ve seen work, albeit sub-optimal:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a single project manager be responsible for ensuring tickets are up to
date. Have a regular sync meeting where individuals give updates and update
the project tracker live.</li>
  <li>Communal updates: whoever happens to ask the question also helps update the
tickets. This is not 100% effective, but does ensure that some updates occur.</li>
  <li>Have a dedicated time, with a program / project manager as a driver, to ask
everyone to update their issues.</li>
  <li>Make it so that the issues are the <em>only</em> way to update management on the
progress of a task: the forcing function will build the habit.</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, none of these are completely effective, but do help.</p>

<h3 id="enabling-deeper-roadmap-discussions">Enabling deeper roadmap discussions</h3>

<p>One reason I believe people gravitate toward ad-hoc planning documents is
because of how the document format (with some commenting infrastructure) allows
for great long-form discussion.</p>

<p>Task tracking is traditionally quite bad at this - you can’t go comment on a
specific aspect of an issue (e.g. one or two lines in it’s description), it’s
hard to see the project overall without going to some other format like a
spreadsheet, which may not sync data back upstream.</p>

<p>At some point, project trackers should start to support this use case.</p>

<h2 id="other-thoughts">Other thoughts</h2>

<h3 id="issue-tracker-should-use-a-global-id-not-namespace-by-project">Issue tracker should use a global id, not namespace by project</h3>

<p>Issue trackers like Jira namespace their issues with a project space (e.g.
PRJ-001). I think a single global id is better, perhaps a sequential,
monotonically increasing integer (e.g. Google buganizer). The metadata for which
project an issue belongs to can live in some other field.</p>

<p>The reasoning is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s easy to move issues from one team to another: links don’t break as
renames happen, you don’t need to keep a table of old ids on the server side.</li>
  <li>It’s straightforward to link issues to another: you don’t need to know which
project it was in.</li>
  <li>It simplifies any linking metadata, to have all issues in the same format
(e.g. pattern matching for APIs and what not).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>I’ll be updating this periodically with some more thoughts, but I’d love to hear
feedback on these patterns if you try them, or let me know about one what works
for you!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="coding" /><category term="project-management" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Design patterns for organizing multi-organization Projects]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">AEPCLI’s design decisions</title><link href="https://y.tsutsumi.io/aepcli-design/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="AEPCLI’s design decisions" /><published>2024-10-22T07:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-10-22T07:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://y.tsutsumi.io/aepcli-thoughts</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://y.tsutsumi.io/aepcli-design/"><![CDATA[<h1 id="aepclis-design-decisions">aepcli’s design decisions</h1>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>In my spare time, I work on <a href="https://aep.dev/">aep.dev</a>, an resource-oriented
API design specification. We’ve done a lot of work around standarization, like
<a href="https://aep.dev/121/">updating guidance on resource-oriented design</a>, fleshing
out standard
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUDL</a> methods, and design patterns.</p>

<p>I wanted to really prove out that those patterns and consistency could be used
to create powerful clients, so I’ve been working on
<a href="https://github.com/aep-dev/aepcli">aepcli</a>: a command-line interface to APIs
that can consume AEP-compliant HTTP+JSON APIs.</p>

<p>I’ve had some design musings as I’ve been writing it, and I wanted to expand on
some here.</p>

<h2 id="installing-aepcli">Installing aepcli</h2>

<p>If you’d like to follow along (<em>warning</em>: it is a very early alpha as of
2024-10-19), you can install aepcli yourself.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://github.com/aep-dev/aepcli">the readme</a> for the latest instructions,
but as of the moment the installation method is a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">go install</code>:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>go <span class="nb">install </span>github.com/aep-dev/aepcli/cmd/aepcli@latest
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="overall-design">Overall design</h2>

<p>aepcli is heavily inspired by
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/">kubectl</a> - itself a command-line
interface that is able to interact with a heterogenous collection of resources (those exposed by the Kubernetes API server). It has been a great reference when designing aepcli.</p>

<h2 id="consuming-an-openapi-definition">Consuming an OpenAPI definition</h2>

<p>aepcli does not need to re-invent the wheel and use new API document syntax -
<a href="https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html">The OpenAPI Specification</a> is
descriptive enough (with the appropriate
<a href="https://aep.dev/4/#annotating-resource-types">extensions</a>) to describe the
resources and operations supported.</p>

<p>This is also similar to how kubectl works - reading and caching an OpenAPI
definition exposed by the Kubernetes api server. For aepcli, the location of the
definition is required, so the path is first positional argument, no matter the
command:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>aepcli https://bookstore.example.com/openapi.json publishers list
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first argument accepts either a URL, or a local file path: this is helpful
in the situation where the API itself does not expose an OpenAPI definition, and
you need to write one yourself. Or better yet, generate one with
<a href="https://github.com/aep-dev/aepc">aepc</a>!</p>

<h2 id="adding-a-config-file">Adding a config file</h2>

<p>It’s a little cumbersome to add configuration for aepcli every time. In
addition, it doesn’t look particularly elegant to include a URL/filename on
every invocation.</p>

<p>Kubectl has the concept of a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/quick-reference/#kubectl-context-and-configuration">context</a>, which helps configure it to the appropriate API server. This allows kubectl to have a one-to-many relationship, being able to operate on multiple different api servers.</p>

<p>So what if we could do that with aepcli? aepcli supports a config file, located at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$HOME/.config/aepcli/config.toml</code> for Linux. You can write something like this:</p>

<div class="language-toml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nn">[apis.roblox]</span>
<span class="py">openapipath</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">"openapi/roblox.json"</span> <span class="c"># relative paths are taken from the `$HOME/.config/aepcli` directory.</span>
<span class="py">headers</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="p">[</span>
    <span class="py">"x-api-key</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="err">${ROBLOX_API_KEY}</span><span class="s">" # add your api key here.</span><span class="err">
</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And aepcli will let you easily refer to that API by it’s name:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>aepcli roblox <span class="nb">users </span>get <span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">USER_ID</span><span class="k">}</span>
<span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="s2">"path"</span>: <span class="s2">"users/</span><span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">USER_ID</span><span class="k">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>,
  <span class="s2">"name"</span>: <span class="s2">"NAME"</span>,
  <span class="s2">"about"</span>: <span class="s2">""</span>,
  <span class="s2">"locale"</span>: <span class="s2">"en_us"</span>,
  <span class="s2">"premium"</span>: <span class="nb">false</span>,
  <span class="s2">"idVerified"</span>: <span class="nb">false</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This makes support of a new API very easy - just write the appropriate entry in
your config, and you’re done!</p>

<p>This one-to-many CLI opens new use cases that other, bespoke CLIs cannot - like
using two APIs together. If you need a user id from an authentication provider,
and want to use that to do a lookup in some other service, you can do something
like:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">USERNAME</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="si">$(</span>aepcli auth-service get <span class="nb">users </span>foo | jq .username<span class="si">)</span>
aepcli docs-service list documents <span class="nt">--user</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">USERNAME</span><span class="k">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="client-side-dynamicism-over-code-generation">client-side dynamicism over code generation</h2>

<p>This point is more nuanced - but aepcli explicity chose to generate the CLI
based on an API description schema, instead of opting toward a code-generated
client.</p>

<p>From my time working at cloud companies, a common issue customers encountered
was with upgrading clients. Whether it was a command-line interface, Terraform
provider or SDK, customers would often have to go through painful upgrades to
use new fields exposed in the resources, since those clients were code-generated or hand-written and
only knew about the fields that the API exposed at the time it was authored.</p>

<p>There are multiple reasons why, in a worst case scenario, these upgrades would take months:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Security review.</li>
  <li>Other executive approvals.</li>
  <li>Waiting for a centralized platform team to perform the update, who often have
limited bandwidth due to serving requests across the whole company.</li>
  <li>A change in the client for a separate resource being backwards-incompatible,
requiring updating usages of that other resource to upgrade.</li>
</ul>

<p>These delays are harmful to both sides: inaccessible features for the consumer
and lost revenue for the service provider.</p>

<p>aepcli is fully dynamic - to use a new field, you don’t need to update any
<em>binaries</em> - you just update the OpenAPI document, which is completely in the
control of the consumer. Do you want access to a new field? Just add it to your
local copy of the OpenAPI document.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Although these are some of the big design considerations, there’s dozens of
smaller ones that I’m sure I’ll hash over at some point. If you have ideas or suggestions, please share them!

<p>If you want to cut to the chase, here’s how you can get your stream recording to create a video if the UI isn’t working:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Navigate to your gamerecording/video directory (under <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.local/share/Steam/userdata/{id}/gamerecordings/video</code>).</li>
  <li>Find the recording you’re looking for (it’s prefixed by date).</li>
  <li>Run: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ffmpeg -i session.mpd -c copy out.mp4</code></li>
</ol>

<p>And you’re done! There’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">out.mp4</code>.</p>

<h2 id="the-story">The story</h2>

<p>Steam recently came out with their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/gamerecording">Game Recording</a> feature, which is absolutely amazing! I love the ability to be able to take videos and share them.</p>

<p>I’ve been using it to record videos of <a href="https://childrenofmorta.com/">Children of Morta</a> in Farsi, and watch the videos later as practice for learning the language. To do so, I like to export my videos to disk, and upload them privately to my youtube account.</p>

<p>But sometimes, the UI doesn’t work as expected, and I can’t download the video. So what do you do?</p>

<p>After some spelunking, I came up with the <a href="#the-punchline">instructions above</a>. The long and the short of it is: steam records your game as a stream, using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.m4s</code> format, and puts the stream information into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">session.mpd</code>.</p>

<p>Luckily, .mpd is a native format supported by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ffmpeg </code> for input, so all you need to do is run ffmpeg!</p>

<p>That’s it! Happy clipping.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="steam" /><category term="coding" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Punchline]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Reflecting on 2023</title><link href="https://y.tsutsumi.io/my-year/2023" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Reflecting on 2023" /><published>2023-12-31T07:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-12-31T07:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://y.tsutsumi.io/my-year/reflecting-on-2023</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://y.tsutsumi.io/my-year/2023"><![CDATA[<p>Another year, another reflection to summarize 1%+ of my life.</p>

<h2 id="japanese">Japanese</h2>

<p>I think my Japanese has reached a plateau, but it’s something I’m comfortable
with for now. The biggest gap is in my vocabulary - I’m still looking up words
in a dictionary every page I read a book or a more mature manga.</p>

<p>But whenever I play video games, I do it in Japanese! That’s a pretty good
benchmark for me, and helps me keep practicing my Japanese aside from my weekly
30 minutes lessons.</p>

<h2 id="farsi">Farsi</h2>

<p>My Farsi has not developed significantly since last year. I’m just on a slow,
steady trajectory of reading one page at a time.</p>

<p>I did pick up one of the stories I read last year and tried it again, and I was
able to get through most of it by myself! In addition, I am able to have <em>some</em>
conversation with my in-laws. So despite the relatively slow progress I’m making
<em>sufficient</em> progress to be satisfied.</p>

<p>Next year though, I’d like to invest more in my Farsi - get to the point where I
can read a good chunk of literature without help from my teacher.</p>

<h2 id="fitness-and-health">Fitness and Health</h2>

<p>I focused heavily on fitness this year, similar to the tail end of last year.</p>

<p>I have yet to do my Dexa scan for end of 2023, but I sit at roughly 180lbs. My
Dexa scan in April showed I had lost 12 pounds of body fat and gained 6 pounds
of muscle since October 2022 - not bad at all for six months!</p>

<p>My second half of the year wasn’t as aggressive - I lost 2 pounds, hopefully fat
but January we will see.</p>

<p>It’s been grueling to get there - my diet now consists of one proper meal a day
(dinner), with protein and huel shakes in between to provide 80 grams of
protein. Between that and soy lattes, I get at minimum 90 grams of protein
before dinner or snacks. That’s putting me at roughly 1.2+ g protein / kg of
body weight, which is less than what most recommend for building muscle mass,
but I haven’t seen much of an issue.</p>

<p>Next year my goal is to stick my diet a bit more, and achieve 12% body fat or
less. Once that happens I think I’ll try to maintain my weight and start
focusing on other things.</p>

<h2 id="zone-2-on-the-treadmill">Zone 2 on the treadmill</h2>

<p>I’ve been struggling to get more Zone 2 exercise into my routine - basically 30+
minutes of my heart rate at 70%-80% of my max heart rate.</p>

<p>This year I found something that works for me - playing videogames on the
treadmill!</p>

<p>I’ve been playing an RPG that keeps me engaged - Persona 4 has worked really
well for me. It also helps that it’s a long RPG, with 100+ hours to beat it.</p>

<p>With that I’ve been able to clear 30 minutes at a 12% incline and 4 miles per
hour without issue, although I don’t get past 45 very often (too late at night
or just get tired of it).</p>

<h2 id="oss-contributions">OSS Contributions</h2>

<p>Since I’ve left Google as TL of API design, I’ve been working on a fork called
https://aep.dev/. It’s been an interesting ride, discussing API design with API
leads at Roblox, IBM, Netflix, and Microsoft.</p>

<p>I built a prototype protobuf generator as part of my work, which was a fun
coding side project. Hopefully in 2024 we’ll see more established and some parts
of the spec entering production use.</p>

<h2 id="random-other-things">Random other things</h2>

<ul>
  <li>My vscode PR was completed by someone else! <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/6966">awesome, this means I can finally
translate my emacs keybindings
over</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="goals-for-2024">Goals for 2024</h2>

<p>Similar to 2023, my 2024 goals are conservative - I’d like to focus on my family
and that means all of my afternoons and a good chunk of my evenings are working
on things relative to them.</p>

<p>But among my goals, they are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Be able to read a Farsi book and understand most of the story (a movie may be
too hard for me).</li>

<p>It looks like configuring alternate buttons to scroll on a regular mouse is
really hard to do on Linux, but I’ve found that trackballs support the ability
to click to make the trackball a scroll wheel, like the <a href="https://elecomusa.com/products/b07dmf2dnw">EX-G PRO

<p>Click to scroll isn’t turned on by default, but it’s easy enough to turn it on

A general concept has solidified for me: a “uniformity cycle” and a “complexity cycle”, and without an intentional philosophy can fall into one naturally.</p>

<h2 id="platforms-and-clients">Platforms and Clients</h2>

<p>For this post, I’m using “platform” to refer to more than one service that together provides functionality or value to a customer. Think clouds where compute, disks, blob storage, and databases are provided and interoperate with each other. Or GitHub which provides repositories, issue tracking, project management tooling, and continuous integration.</p>

<p>These services are designed to interoperate with each other, and often come with a set of shared <em>clients</em> that consume them. Think command lines, visual user interfaces, and SDKs in various languages.</p>

<h2 id="the-complexity-cycle">The Complexity Cycle</h2>

<p>Clients start out very simple: there are usually a small handful of services that exist, and the integration occurs manually. Not a lot of thought is given into what is sharable or not at this phase, sans common industry wide standards like HTTP or authentication. The services have autonomy, and the integration cost with clients seems marginal to an organization since the feature set is small.</p>

<p>However, as time goes on, this cost of client-server integration becomes costly.
What’s worse, if there’s a desire to introduce some common feature in a client
for <em>all</em> services, it is difficult to do so since every client is hand-coded. For example, if generic functionality around listing resources is desired, it must be added to every integration, and must be integrated by hand as likely the service’s implementation of listing resources differs.</p>

<p>Since everything in the clients is hand-written, there is little value in developing standard behavior, so services continue to implement differing functionality that serves a similar purpose.</p>

<p>This whole loop is an example of what I’m calling a “complexity cycle”:</p>

<div class="jekyll-diagrams diagrams mermaid">
  Command Not Found: mmdc
</div>

<h2 id="the-uniformity-cycle">The Uniformity Cycle</h2>

<p>So how do we address this cycle of complexity, that will erode the value of a
common platform? By promoting (or sometimes enforcing) <em>uniformity</em>.</p>

<p>If non-uniform schema or behavior makes it harder for clients to integrate with
services, then more uniform schema behavior reduces the cost. If the client
depends <em>only</em> on uniform behavior, then the clients are extremely simple to
maintain and author: their cost is effectively O(1) to integrate with all
compliance services.</p>

<p>This in turn motivates the services themselves to be more consistent: new services, as they are created, <em>must</em> adhere to the uniformity requirements (even if implicit) as the clients do not allow configuration or hand-written code.</p>

<p>This opposite a complexity cycle can be described as a “uniformity cycle”:</p>

<div class="jekyll-diagrams diagrams mermaid">
  Command Not Found: mmdc
</div>

<p>A uniformity cycle can keep costs low across both services and clients:</p>

<ul>
  <li>As services must have more uniform behavior, more shared platforms can be created to reduce the cost of these features (e.g. auth or storing state)</li>
  <li>New universal service features are also easier to roll out, as they rely more on a shared platform.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-flip-the-cycle">How to flip the cycle</h2>

<p>Reversing the cycle from complexity to uniformity requires a strategy that spans across both the platform and it’s clients. Oftentimes a single individual does not have the ability to flip things, nor does a single change flip the cycle.</p>

<p>But several patterns exist, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When supporting new features in a client using new server behavior (e.g. filtering on a list), require a specific implementation of that behavior. When asked to support a different implementation, have a hard design discussion on why, and try to fold any requirements back into the existing implementation.</li>
  <li>Build fast feedback service-client loops: if service producers can see the
direct impact on the clients and see undesirable behaviors, they can change them in the service early on in the cycle rather than right at the end when the team has deadlines.</li>
  <li>Build common behavior into existing shared infrastructure such that services do not have control over the implementation: API gateways are a great place to introduce new features.</li>
</ul>

<p>After time, the cycle can flip.</p>

<h2 id="should-we-always-design-for-uniformity">Should we always design for uniformity?</h2>

<p>No. It is a common case for the need to diverge in behavior to be justified, and a necessity for a platform to become more configurable to address it.</p>

<p>However, it is best to <em>minimize</em> the variation for the services and the amount of flexible handling in the client.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="coding" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been doing a lot of work on platforms recently, specifically to how it pertains to clients.

<p>The solution I’ve come to is that the fourth sage has the label WWW, with the contents of his box WWB. My reasoning is as follows:</p>

<h2 id="the-first-sage-has-bb">The first sage has BB*</h2>

<p>The puzzle states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first sage takes out two black balls and says, “I know the color of the third ball.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the sage has taken out BB, there are only two options for the final ball: W and B. The only way for the first sage to know the answer is if the sage has a label with the opposite. For example, if the label is BBW, then the contents of the box must be BBB since we know the contents of the boxes must not match the label.</p>

<p>Therefore, there are two options for the first sage:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Sage</th>
      <th>Label</th>
      <th>Ball</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>BBB</td>
      <td>BBW</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>BBW</td>
      <td>BBB</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="the-second-sage-has-bw">The second sage has BW*</h2>

<p>Onto the second sage, who says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The second sage takes out one black and one white ball and says, “I know the color of the third ball.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We know the contents of the box must be BBW or BWW. Similar to the first sage, we can assume the second sage has the opposite pairing:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Sage</th>
      <th>Label</th>
      <th>Ball</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>BBW</td>
      <td>BWW</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>BWW</td>
      <td>BBW</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="the-third-sage-has-label-bb">The third sage has label BB*</h2>

<p>The third sage is interesting:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The third sage takes out two white balls and says, “I don’t know the color of the third ball.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The third sage has the following information at this point:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sage 1’s box contains BB* (BBB or BBW)</li>
  <li>sage 2’s box contains BW* (BBW or BWW)</li>
  <li>sage 3’s box contains WW* (BWW or WWW)</li>
  <li>sage 3’s label.</li>
</ul>

<p>So what label could sage 3 have such that he cannot eliminate either BWW or WWW as a possible candidate?</p>

<p>Among the labels BBB, BBW, BWW, and WWW, the valid candidate are BBW and BBB:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if 3’s label is WWW, then the box must contain BWW.</li>
  <li>if 3’s label is BWW, then the box must contain WWW.</li>
</ul>

<p>So the third sage must have the labels BBB or BBW, the opposite of whatever sage 1 has.</p>

<p>So sage 3’s options are:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Sage</th>
      <th>Label</th>
      <th>Ball</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>BBB</td>
      <td>WWB</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>BBB</td>
      <td>WWW</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>BBW</td>
      <td>WWB</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>BBW</td>
      <td>WWW</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="sage-4">Sage 4</h2>

<p>So now we get to sage 4:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The fourth sage says, without taking out any balls, “I know the color of all the balls in my box and also the content of all the other boxes.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sage 4 has the same knowledge and reasoning as we do. So we know that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sage 1 and Sage 3’s labels are BBW or BBB.</li>
  <li>Sage 2’s label is one of BBW or BWW.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since sage 1 and 3 have labels of BBW and BBB, then sage 2’s label must be BWW. Since all other labels are taken, sage 4’s label must be WWW.</p>

<p>If sage 2’s label is BWW and they know the contents of their box, then their box must contain BBW.</p>

<p>This also means that sage 1’s box is clear: it is BBB, which implies that sage 1’s label is BBW:</p>

<p>So we know the following:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Sage</th>
      <th>Label</th>
      <th>Ball</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>BBW</td>
      <td>BBB</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>BWW</td>
      <td>BBW</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>BBB</td>
      <td>WW*</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>WWW</td>
      <td>???</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Since the sage knows their label is WWW, they know that their box must not contain WWW. Since sage 3 has drawn WW*, it must contain WWW. By deduction the last sage must have the oly remaining combination, which is WWB:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Sage</th>
      <th>Label</th>
      <th>Ball</th>
    </tr>

      <td>3</td>
      <td>BBB</td>
      <td>WWW</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10937404.2023.2213903">sucralose-6-acetate</a>,
a genotoxicin which is apparently found in sucralose.</p>

<p>I wanted to dive in a little bit more, here are some findings and thoughts.</p>

<p><em>note</em>: I am not a medical professional, and nothing I say here constitutes
any medical advice. It’s my own opinions and theories.</p>

<h2 id="is-sucralose-safe">Is sucralose safe</h2>

<p>To answer the most important question first: I think there’s evidence that at
minimum, sucralose does not lead to a significant increase in cancer. Several
studies exist that show at best a minor increase (~10%) <em>correlated</em> with
sucralose.</p>

<p>That said, the following concerns is making me consider removing sucralose from
my daily diet:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The study mentioned showing it contains a possible genotoxin.</li>
  <li>The possible correlation between sucralose and increased insulin levels.</li>
  <li>A possible correlation between sucralose and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-alcoholic_fatty_liver_disease">NAFLD</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The NAFLD one especially gives me pause, as it is a good marker for metabolic
health.</p>

<p>Over the past year (2023), I’ve lowered my sucralose intake by 75%, down to
roughly one sweetened protein shake a day.</p>

<h2 id="in-vivo-vs-in-vitro">In-vivo vs in-vitro</h2>

<p>It’s worth noting that the study talks about <em>in-vitro</em> experiments: these are
done in a petri dish or something similar, and not in a live animal. Therefore
there could be other biological processes that make this a non-concern. On the
other hand, there could also be processes in an in-vivo environment that make
this worse.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-a-genotoxin">What is a a genotoxin?</h2>

<p>At it’s core, a genotoxin is something that is known to break down DNA. Since
cancer is caused by mutations in the DNA, genotoxins are highly correlate to
cancer.</p>

<p>I found a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6195886/">paper that explains the definition in a little bit more
detail</a>, at least
defining what genotixicity means in the context of carcinogens. The summary is
genotoxic carcinogens directly affect DNA and that is the cause of the
carcinogen, while non-genotoxic uses some other mechanism, perhaps indirect
like hormonal.</p>

<p>It’s not super clear if there is such a thing as non-carcinogenic genotoxin. The
abstract states that there is no such thing as a same threshold with a
genotoxin: It’s really just a matter of risk level.</p>

<h2 id="what-amount-of-sucralose-is-safe">What amount of sucralose is safe?</h2>

<p>Assuming the study holds true, what amount of sucralose is safe?</p>

<ul>
  <li>The study says 0.67% of sucralose is sucralose-6-acetate.</li>
  <li>The European Food and Safety Administration states the limit of genotoxins
ingested should be 0.0025 μg/kg bw.</li>
</ul>

<p>The amount of sucralose relative to a microgram of sucralose-6-acetate is ~150.
so 150μg of sucralose per 1μg of sucralose-6-acetate.</p>

<p>So for an 80kb person, the daily limit would be: 80 * 0.0025 = 0.2μg. So * 150
that would be at most <em>30μg</em> of sucralose-6-acetate.</p>

<p>The US sucralose recommended daily allotment is 5mg/kg bw /d. most drinks
contains at least 10mg.</p>

<p>So 10mg of sucralose would be <em>333 times</em> the amount of genotoxin I should be
ingesting.</p>

<p>Effectively, there is no practical amount of sucralose that is safe.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The study is worth taking seriously: clearly sucralose contains a lot of a
genotoxin. However, this doesn’t correlate well with the fact that multiple
studies have shown that sucralose does not lead to a meaningful increase in
cancer.</p>

<p>Although I won’t be buying any more sucralose products, I think the above
means one of three things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The studies on cancer correlations have the wrong conclusion.</li>
  <li>The genotoxic nature of sucralose-6-acetate is somehow ameliorated by some
other biological process.</li>
  <li>The EFSA limitations are low: as weird as it sounds, it may take a higher
concentration of genotoxins to lead to a meaningful increase in cancer.</li>

<p><a href="http://huel.com/">Huel</a> aims to provide sustainable, plant-based meals cheap. Their normal offering is a meal replacement shake, which I can’t get myself to consume regularly. I like their <a href="https://huel.com/products/huel-hot-savory">“Hot and Savory”</a> meals because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>easy to prepare and clean up: you just throw some hydrated food in and add water.</li>
  <li>extremely filling. I eat a 400 calorie amount and I’m full for hours (noon until ~4-5pm).</li>
  <li>plant-based</li>
</ul>

<p>“Hot and Savory” is amazing for that: I’ve fiddled with various plant-based lunch combinations and found it impossible to find something filling.</p>

<h2 id="snack-protein-shake--almondmilk">Snack: protein shake + almondmilk</h2>

<p>To help get a boost of protein, I drink a shake made from protein powder
 (plant-based) and almondmilk.</p>

<h2 id="dinner-whatever-usually-vegan">Dinner: whatever, usually vegan</h2>

<p>For dinner I’m pretty loose, since the rest of my meals are quite regimented. A majority are vegan or minimal animal-based (grain bowls, veggie burgers and fries, phad thai), and sometimes things like sushi, grilled salmon, past, etc.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="diet" /><category term="health" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[NOTE: this is a copy of /diet from 2020.
