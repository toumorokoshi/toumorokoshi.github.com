One of the most

English Grammar is a Terrible Programming Default
-------------------------------------------------

Consider how you would specify that a room is for guests in English,
or a car is designed to be sporty. In both cases, the specifier comes
before the object or category:

- Sports Car
- Guest Room
- Persian Cat

Since programming languages are primarily based on English, it's a natural default to name your variables in a similar order:

- PersianCat
- TabbyCat
- SiameseCat

To further qualify your classes, one prepends additional information:

- RedTabbyCat
- BlueTabbyCat
- BlackTabbyCat

And the pattern continues. As more qualifiers are added, the more names are prepended.

This reads well, if our main goal was to make software read as close
to english as possible. However, the typical markers of well written
software is quite a bit different
