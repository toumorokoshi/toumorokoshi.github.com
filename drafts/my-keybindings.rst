My Editor Keybindings
=====================

As with many software developers, I'm kind of a stickler for efficiency. When
working text is your medium, repetition presents itself in many ways. And
keybindings are one of the core building blocks to reduce that reptition.

Before we dive into keybindings themselves, I'd like to declare an axiom first:

    for standard typing, not using the mouse can always be more efficient than using the mouse

Mouses are great for a more freeform experience, or if you're unable to type.
But a mouse is ultimately a crutch: depending on your typing speed, you can
basically type a whole paragraph before you complete some actions with a mouse.

If you can't accomplish what you want with a keyboard faster than with a mouse,
it's a good time to examine your workflow with a keyboard and see if there's
additional commands you can use to speed yourself up.

Okay, now onto the actual discussion.

The factors to optimize
-----------------------

My preference is to enable as much efficiency as possible, while ensuring
health.

That basically means: as few easy-to-reach keystrokes as possible to accomplish
what you want. Choosing very hard or complex keystrokes are damaging in the long
term.

Keys that abuse weaker fingers, such as your pinkies, can cause a lot of damage.

So, what sort of keys are available in this situation?

* the standard alphabet
* spacebar
*

The mapping
-----------

Remap the following keys:

* right shift -> escape (closer to the pinky)
* caps lock -> control (closer to the pinky)
* vim keybindings + model

* use layered control buttons to attach commands to.
If we use all the characters and all chords are two characters long, we
have 26 * 26 = 676 key chords available to choose from. That's quite a few,
even if we optimize and enable common ones like ctrl-s.
