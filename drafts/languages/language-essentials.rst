Learning a new language is not easy, and you won't pick a new one up
overnight. But it doesn't have to be harder than it already is.

Over the past several days, I traveled across four countries in
Europe, for varying degrees of time.


From what I've experienced, there's a few key areas of proficiency
necessary to be able to both understand and speak a language to get
your point across. Knowing these doesn't guarantee proficiency: it
only guarantees you can at least survive.

Here's those key areas (or at least the ones I've found):

* The 5 Q's + how
    * Who, what, when, where, why, how
* Conjugate rules for majority of verbs
    * present, past, and future tense
* Interjections
    * e.g. hello, goodbye, excuse me
* know common verbs
    * eat, sleep, help, can, would like / want
* know all the pronouns and how to describe ownership
    * I, you, my, yours, theirs
* Describe location and objects
    * This, that, there, here
* Timothy Ferriss's 12 key phrases (plus some more)


Let's talk about each of these in detail.

The Five Question Words, Plus How
---------------------------------

The five question words are absolutely essential when learning a new language, and especially when traveling in a foreign country.
