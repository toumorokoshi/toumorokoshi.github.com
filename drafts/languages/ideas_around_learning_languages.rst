Hacking Language Learning
=========================

Let's start with a disclaimer: I'm not a teacher, and I have no
experience in teaching languages. I've been trying to learn quite a
few though. Everything stated here is in my own, anecdotal case study
opinion.

If the goal is some level or proficiency, I feel like the standard courses
don't accomplish that. Almost everyone I've talked to has started
learning a language in either primary or secondary education, but very few have
retained enough to continue to be proficient.

This post marks the start of my journey toward a reproducible
curriculum that will produce language proficient individuals. I define
one as proficient in a language when:

* one can listen (if applicable) to a conversation in a target
  language at the speed natives speak, and understand the majority of the content.
* one can read and write in the target language.
* one makes grammatical mistakes 1% of the time.
* one can speak in the target language, with a pronunciation that's
  understandable by a native speaker.

Seeing as the US Department of State has their own `definition
<https://careers.state.gov/gateway/lang_prof_def.html>`_, I would put
my goal at a 3: minimal professional proficiency.

Here's some of the things I think are worth being a primary focus:

--------------------------------
Making Language Practice A Habit
--------------------------------

Beyond all else, languages require a very large time investment, over
a long period of time. Memorization is a huge part of learning
languages: two thousand words is probably around the bare minimum to
hold a free-form conversation in a language. Memorization comes with
practice and repetition. In order for someone to keep their language
proficiency, languages must practiced routinely: in other words,
language practice must be a habit.

-------------------
Useful from Day One
-------------------

Learning a language comes with the steep learning curve: There is a
lot of knowledge to absorb, and the usefulness of that knowledge
increases exponentially near the end, but is very slow in the
beginning.

The goal here would be to teach the material in a way where value is
maximized near the beginning. A high initial reward helps build a
habit that will take a student to language proficiency.

I'm bilingual in Japanese and English, so I will be using Japanese as
my test language for a lot of my teaching experiments. If you're
