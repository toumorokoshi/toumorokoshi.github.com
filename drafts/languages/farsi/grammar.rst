----------
Past Tense
----------

Past tense is conjugated in a standard way:

* drop the "an" at the end (e.g. dashtan)
* add the proper ending based on the pronoun.
    * dashtam -> I had
    * dashti -> you had
    * dasht -> s/he/it had
    * dashteem -> we had
    * dashteed -> you all had

------------
Future Tense
------------

We use the verb "to want", and then we don't conjugate the past tense:

* khosham dasht -> I will have
* khoshi dasht -> You will have

Note here that the conjugation includes the second verb conjugated in
a similar fashion to the third person singular: this is correct. It is the
"infinitive", and the regular infinitive (dashtan) is never used.
