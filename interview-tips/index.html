  </header>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>The purpose of this page is to help you be the best candidate you can be in an
interview, based on the handful of times I’ve interviewed for a new role in
tech. Possibly some of this is applicable to other industries.</p>

<p>The point is not to “game” the interview by knowing the right answers to every
question - it’s more about making sure that interviewers can see your strongest
skills, and get a sense of how you really are as a possible teammate.</p>

<h2 id="general-advice">General advice</h2>

<h3 id="luck-is-involved-and-you-can-try-again">Luck is involved, and you can try again</h3>

<p>Interviewing is stressful, and it can feel very personal when you get rejected.
Although we’d like to believe that interviewing and humans are completely
objective and accurate, the reality is that neither are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You could get that one coding question you don’t know very well.</li>
  <li>For whatever reason, you might just not gel with your interviewer.</li>
</ul>

<p>These things happen! It’s important to take it in stride:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Talk to the recruiter and see what you could have done differently.</li>
  <li>Do some self reflection on where the issue was, and find resources to help.</li>
  <li>See if it’s okay to try again at some point in the future.</li>
  <li>Implement some changes based on the above.</li>
</ul>

<p>And move on to the next job hunt. A rejection is painful, but getting terribly
emotional on every failure will make the process all that more stressful.</p>

<h2 id="coding">Coding</h2>

<h3 id="coding-interviews">Coding Interviews</h3>

<p>Many companies do some form of data structures and algorithm interview.</p>

<p>I think a lot of people think this is just straight “leetcode” - solving the
problem is all that matters, pass or fail. In my experience as an interviewer at
Google and Zillow, it’s more than that. There are some companies that only care
about whether you solve the puzzle, but in my experience that’s a minority.</p>

<p>Here’s my high level advice:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Listen to your interviewer! They are generally there to help you. If they’re
giving you hints, don’t ignore them. Engage in the conversation at least.</li>
  <li>Try to think out loud: it helps the interviewer understand you better.
    <ul>
      <li>Are there any tradeoffs to your approach?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Code like you’re coding for production, but quickly:
    <ul>
      <li>Use good variable naming.</li>
      <li>Follow proper design (object-oriented programming as needed, pure functions
as much as possible).</li>
      <li>Include some light comments if the algorithm is complicated.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Test your code.
    <ul>
      <li>Walk through a couple test cases (one happy path and edge case as
necessary).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Do practice leetcode! It’s helpful to practice in a time-constrained
environment and re-familiarize yourself with the standard library of your
language of choice.</li>
</ul>

<p>I recommend <a href="https://leetcode.com/">leetcode medium</a>, as well as running through
<a href="https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/">cracking the coding interview</a>.</p>

<p>Things that could help specifically:</p>

<ul>
  <li>remembering boilerplate code to avoid time spent not focusing on the specific
algorithm challenge.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="using-leetcode-to-practice">Using leetcode to practice</h4>

<ol>
  <li>read the problem statement. Consider edge cases before reading the examples.</li>
  <li>check the examples. See if you captured all of the edge cases.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="design-interviews">Design Interviews</h3>

<p>For design interviews, I recommend reading up on <a href="https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview">Grokking the system design
interview</a>.</p>

<p>Tips include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a checklist memorized to run through the basics including:
    <ul>
      <li>verifying assumptions (usage patterns, load requirements, geolocation of users).</li>
      <li>estimating capacity, regionalization requirements.</li>
      <li>authoring a high level architecture diagram.
        <ul>
          <li>discuss the tradeoffs you’re making.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>working through the end-to-end request workflow and clarifying missing details.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Try to deep dive on the areas you know well: the main goal of design interviews
is to understand your expertise and experience in tackling these problems.</p>

<h3 id="engineering-management">Engineering Management</h3>

<p>For engineering management, think about and have examples for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How to grow your team.</li>
  <li>How to approach a larger difficult strategy problem.
    <ul>
      <li>breaking it down, identifying the problem (technical? organizational?)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How to measure impact.</li>
  <li>How to address underperforming team members.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="behavioral-questions">Behavioral Questions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Only use stories that you remember well and can speak to! Most interviewers
will drill down into one of your stories, and you won’t know which.</li>
  <li>Have 5-6 stories around your experiences in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation,_task,_action,_result">STAR
format</a>.</li>
  <li>Have some stories around projects that didn’t go as well as expected. Showing
reflection and growth is important.</li>
</ul>
