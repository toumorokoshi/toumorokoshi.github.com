For the past three years, I've been wrestling with dentist's
appointments with worse and worse results. I've attempted to work
meticulously off of their advice, but the result seems to just keep
getting bleaker.

Now I have six cavities to fill, and seven new problem areas since six
months ago. How did this happen!? I'm taking care of my teeth better
than before, at least as far as taking advice.

So the advice I've been given isn't working. Time to for a deep dive
into how to keep your teeth, and a first post in a series I call, "How To Not Die".

----------
The Rollup
----------

Don't want to read through the science? No problem. Here's what to
do, in order of increasing priority:

* drink flouridated water (check labels, and your local water supply)
* brush with flouride toothpaste
* use flouride rinse 0.05% daily
* eat meet
* eat leafy veggies
* crunchy veggies
* celery

Beware of flouridation for young kids! Adults are much, much less
susceptible.

What Causes Tooth Decay
-----------------------

Tooth decay is the process of the removal of enamel from your
tooth. Enamel is the outermost layer of a tooth, and protects the
dentin and pulp inside.

Breaking through the enamel layer effectively begins the process of
killing a tooth. And regardless of how it comes to be, acid is what
destroys enamel.

Luckily, enamel can be recovered, as long as the tooth decay isn't too
severe. Under certain conditions, teeth can remineralize, and recover
the enamel that was lost by the acid.

Thus, there are two mains goals:

1. do whatever it takes to prevent acid from getting near your tooth.
2. do whatever it takes to ensure remineralization.
