About Me
========

I am a web programmer, mainly interested in back-end and in-house tool
development. I graduated from the University of Washington in December
2011 with degrees in Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, and Physics.

I wrote my first application in 2008, an address book written in perl.

I have a variety of interests in the software engineering field, mainly:

* improving developer workflows and bootstrapping
* making testing painless and easy
* building an extremely powerful editor with an open-source base
