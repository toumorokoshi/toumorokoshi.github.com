About Me
========

I am a web programmer, mainly interested in back-end and in-house tool
development. I graduated from the University of Washington in December
2011 with degrees in Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, and Physics.

I wrote my first application in 2008, an address book written in perl.

I have a variety of interests in the software engineering field, mainly:

* improving developer workflows and bootstrapping
* creating efficient and valuable test suites and tools
* programming language and language VM design
