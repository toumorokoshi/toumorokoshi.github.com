Sprinter
========

`Sprinter <http://sprinter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ is a tool to
help bootstrap developer environments and keep them in sync.

Slimy: HTML5 Slideshow
======================

`Slimy <https://github.com/toumorokoshi/slimy>`_ is an HTML5 slideshow designed for simplicity. Basically, it was
built off the principles of simple and quick creation of slideshows,
utilizing the most recent HTML5 and CSS3 standards, and lack of onlide
dependencies. These ensure a very robust, universal and experience
with offline compatability. You can see an example of slimy in action
`here <http://slimy.googlecode.com/git/example.html>`_

3D Holographic Projector
========================

My final project for my undergraduate degrees, the 3D Hologpraphic
projector generates a holographic image by reflecting an image off of
a spinning, angled mirror, changing images rapidly to project
different images to different angles, effectively creating a
three-dimensional, holographic image. The design is based off of the
one a group from `USC <http://gl.ict.usc.edu/Research/3DDisplay/>`_
created. In addition the projector, an interface was also created to
interface with the 3D object, utilizing the Microsoft Kinect. A video
of the project can be seen below:
