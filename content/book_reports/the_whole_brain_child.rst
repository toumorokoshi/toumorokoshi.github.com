`The Whole Brain Child <https://www.amazon.com/Whole-Brain-Child-Revolutionary-Strategies-Developing/dp/0553386697>`_ discusses strategies to teach children how to deal with difficult situations in an empathetic and rational way.

Despite the focus on teaching children, I found this book included a lot of great insights for adults as well. In general, it's a great guidebook on how to deal with emotional situations, and how to ensure that the approach is one that accounts for the impact on others and their well-being.

The general structure is emphasizing a few key strategies when encountering and emotional and upset child. Here's my interpretation of the general ideas:

* mind sight?

Introspect when Encountering Conflict
*************************************

The book posits that we have two different "brains" that work in tandem when encountering a difficult situations: the "lizard brain" which reacts with strong emotional responses, and the "upstairs brain" which can approach the situation rationally.

Along the theme of educating children on how to cope in situations of conflict, the book explains that, to best help someone understand the situations, it's first better to empathize with how the chid is feeling, then deconstruct the situation rationally. This quiets the immediate reaction of the lizard brain, and enables a discussion when your child is using their upstairs brain.

As an example: if your child is throwing a tantrum because the are not getting the ice cream they wanted, it's first best to acknowledge the feelings of the child first ("you seem angry"), then rationally explain that eating too much ice cream is not a good choice.

This lessons works great for children, but I see it as a great lesson for conflicts with adults: if you want to reach an agreement with someone and you have a strong emotional reaction, first acknowledge the emotions, then reconcile on a logical leve.

Physical Activities to Clear Your Mind
**************************************

The book references a study that explains that physical activities can help calm emotional reactions, and bring someone into the state to discuss the situation rationally. Thus, a good tool may be to help pace the room, or do some jumping jacks, before diving into the conflict itself.

* Talking through the traumatic situation over and over again
* Thinking about the larger picture
  * I use this a lot to bring myself back from an emotional situation (It's just a job, even if something happens here I still have a lot more in life).
* Introspect to understand why you're feeling that well.
* Help explain empathy
