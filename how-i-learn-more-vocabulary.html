</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>When it comes to reaching language proficiency, vocabulary is
important. To reach proficiency as <cite>quickly</cite> as possible, the <cite>choice</cite> of
vocabulary is important.</p>
<p>I'm going to explain my approach a bit.</p>
<div class="section" id="how-to-learn-vocabulary">
<h2>How To Learn Vocabulary</h2>
<p>Vocabulary from a spoken standpoint requires quick recall without a
reference, which is really only attained by practicing the same exact
things over and over again.</p>
<p>I use flash cards, because they're the most
straightforward review method. I have two flash cards per word, one
testing translating from the language, and another translating to.</p>
<p>Anki is a great choice for any flash card learning, because it stores
your data about what you've learned, and modifies the frequency of the
cards accordingly: <a class="reference external" href="http://ankisrs.net/">http://ankisrs.net/</a></p>
<p>Regardless of the medium, the real challenge is investing the time and
effort. It's very easy to stop once you're a week in, or a month
in. In order to minimize this risk, vocabulary needs to be a routine:
it must be a part of one's daily schedule.</p>
<p>For me, I've made my commute to and from work into review time for my
language flash cards. I listen to the same playlist (something with no
vocals), start up Anki, and get to work until I've reviewed them
all. I've been doing it with German for over a year (roughly 30
minutes per weekday), and I've learned about 800 words completely.</p>
<p>Per word, it's taken me 7500 (~50 weeks * 5 days * 30 minutes a day) /
800 ~= 10 minutes a word. Not bad (although some are easier than
others).</p>

<div class="section" id="what-vocabulary-to-learn">
<h2>What Vocabulary to Learn</h2>
<p>Timothy Ferris has <a class="reference external" href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/2009/01/20/learning-language/">a great blog post</a> about
learning languages (<a class="reference external" href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/2014/03/21/how-to-learn-a-foreign-language-2/">a couple</a>,
actually) where he talks about finding the most frequently used words
and learning those first. It's a statistical method that is the best value for
your time in terms of vocabulary.</p>
<p>For any given language, a Google search will probably find a list
somewhere. In the case of Japanese In the case of Japanese, there's a
great post showing the most common terms used:
<a class="reference external" href="http://pomax.nihongoresources.com/index.php?entry=1222520260">http://pomax.nihongoresources.com/index.php?entry=1222520260</a>. Even if
you don't understand the grammar at all, the vocabulary alone helps
you get a great context on a conversation.</p>
<p>It's worth emphasizing the distinction between spokend and written
word frequency. My suggestion would be start with spoken.</p>
<p>My suggestion would be to learn the first 100 or 200 words. This
provides a solid base of roughly one half of all spoken words.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="where-to-find-more-vocab">
<h2>Where to Find More Vocab</h2>
<p>After you have a good base set of words, I would move on to learning
vocab that really interests you. Find a book, tv show, or game that is
available in your target language, and add any vocab you don't know
into the flash cards as you go.</p>
<p>For me, I wanted to learn German.  Luckily, I love video games, a
medium that fairly often has spoken dialog and text. I found a game
I've wanted to play for a while, converted all text and audio to
German, and started it up.</p>
<p>As soon as I encountered a word I didn't know, I paused the game,
wrote up a flash card, and continued to play.  As soon as I reached
100 new words, I stopped playing the game; I was only allowed to
resume when I had finished learning all my outstanding vocabulary.</p>
<p>The beginning of this process was incredibly painful: I would play for
maybe half an hour before I had over one hundred words to cover! But
as time passed, I learned more, and the game began to move a bit more
quickly. I also sometimes found places in the game where I was unable
to pause. In that case, I used youtube videos of others playing the
game to supplement: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=let%27s+play+deutsch">let's plays in German</a></p>
<p>For Japanese, if you like video games you're there: <a class="reference external" href="http://store.steampowered.com/search/?snr=1_4_4__12&amp;term=#sort_by=_ASC&amp;supportedlang=japanese&amp;page=1">there are lots</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/292120/?snr=1_7_15__13">of
Japanese</a>
<a class="reference external" href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/8870/?snr=1_7_7_230_150_3">video games with full audio.</a></p>
<p>If you prefer TV or movies, I'd suggest a website like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.crunchyroll.com/videos/drama">Crunchyroll</a> or Netflix. I think
Japanese comics (Manga) is also a very good choice: unfortunately it's
not available readily online. However, I've found that buying whole
series' from EBay to be a straightforward process.</p>
