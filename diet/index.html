    <p>This is some notes about how I eat, and why.</p>

<h2 id="major-ideas">Major Ideas</h2>

<h3 id="mostly-vegan-plant-based-diet">Mostly vegan (plant-based diet)</h3>

<p><a href="https://y.tsutsumi.io/2020/03/04/book-report-the-blue-zones/">People who eat a plant-based diet live 7 years longer</a>.</p>

<p>It’s hard for me to go completely vegan (I like my seafood and dairy), so I try to go for vegan meals most of the week, with 1-2 dinners non-vegan.</p>

<p>From what I read in Blue Zones (above), eating meat once a week still helps you get a lot of the longevity benefits.</p>

<h3 id="high-protein">High-protein</h3>

<p>I found out about <a href="https://peterattiamd.com/">Peter Attia</a> in 2022: who has been an awesome source of information for longevity.</p>

<p>One of his ideas is that the current recommendation for protein (50g / day) is much too low, and doesn’t enable enough nutrient availability for optimal muscle hypertrophy (alone with lifting weights). Low lean body mass is one of the biggest indicators of poor health and longevity.</p>

<p>Peter recommends 1.8-3 grams / kg / day. For me, at 83kg, that would equate to 150 grams of protein minimum.</p>

<p>I don’t go that extreme at the moment, but I do strive for 120 grams.</p>

<p>With a vegan diet, that number is likely higher: vegan proteins are not always complete, and may not be in an easily digestable form unlike meat.</p>

<h3 id="targetting-1700-kcal--day">Targetting 1700 kcal / day</h3>

<p>I’m currently in the middle of trying to lose weight: my last Dexa scan in 2022/10 put me at 21% body fat, which is much higher than I’m hoping. My current target is 15% body fat, which means I have to lose 12 lbs of body weight.</p>

<p>To that end, I’m looking at some minor caloric restriction: at 1700 kcal / day, and assuming I can build up a daily caloric expendature of 2100 kcal, that would be me at 3500 / (2100 - 1700) ~ 8.75 days to lose a pound of weight. And ideally I could my weight in 108 days (~4 months).</p>

<p>I’m mixing that with lifting weights to try to guarantee muscle hypertrophy.</p>

<p>In reality my caloric intake is often higher due to limited self-control, but I’m working on that.</p>

<h2 id="daily-routine">Daily Routine</h2>

<h3 id="breakfast-protein-shake">Breakfast: Protein Shake</h3>

<p>From Layne Norton, a nutritionist, the likely best times to ingest protein is in the morning and evening: after and before large fasting periods to ensure protein availability.</p>

<p>I currently consume Huel protein shakes (vegan) of 40g, at roughly 220kcal.</p>

<h3 id="lunch-huel-hot-and-savory">Lunch: Huel Hot and Savory</h3>

<p><a href="http://huel.com/">Huel</a> aims to provide sustainable, plant-based meals cheap. Their normal offering is a meal replacement shake, which I can’t get myself to consume regularly. I like their <a href="https://huel.com/products/huel-hot-savory">“Hot and Savory”</a> meals because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>easy to prepare and clean up: you just throw some hydrated food in and add water.</li>
  <li>extremely filling. I eat a 400 calorie amount and I’m full for hours (noon until ~4-5pm).</li>
  <li>plant-based</li>
</ul>

<p>“Hot and Savory” is amazing for that: I’ve fiddled with various plant-based lunch combinations and found it impossible to find something filling.</p>

<p>In 2022 I started mixing with with Huel unflavored protein powder to bulk it up to 40g / protein / 400 calories.</p>

<p>To further promote weight loss, I’m reducing my lunch down to 200 calories.</p>

<h3 id="dinner-whatever-usually-vegan">Dinner: whatever, usually vegan</h3>

<p>For dinner I’m pretty loose, since the rest of my meals are quite regimented. A majority are vegan or minimal animal-based (grain bowls, veggie burgers and fries, phad thai), and sometimes things like sushi, grilled salmon, past, etc.</p>

<h3 id="after-dinner-snack-protein-shake">After-dinner snack: protein shake</h3>

<p>Following up with protein availability again before the largest fastest period, I consume 40g of protein.</p>

<h3 id="totals">Totals</h3>

<p>Overall:</p>

<h2 id="other-tips">Other tips</h2>

<h3 id="eating-a-bite-every-2-minutes">Eating a bite every 2 minutes</h3>

<p>With such a lower calorie count, it’s very easy to be starving at the end of the night and need to eat.</p>

<p>To curb that, I’m trying to eat a bite every 2 minutes: a study showed that it takes ~20 minutes to feel full (having trouble finding the source). So if I eat a bit every 10 minutes, that’s only 10 bites and I’ll start feeling full and my hunger begins to subside.</p>
