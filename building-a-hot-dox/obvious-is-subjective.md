# The power of learning patterns?

A few years back, I had coffee with an aspiring software developer, who wanted to know why he wasn't get offers.

We chatted a bit about the types of questions he was asked during interviews. They were standard coding, data structures and algorithm questions. He gave a specific example which escapes me today, but it had to do with iterating an array.

Listening to person describe their solution, it could have been done more efficiently.

I pointed out the sub-optimality of the answer, and suggested that the person go verify their answers online as they go through coding questions, to see if there are any better solutions. I pointed him at some [standard resources](http://leetcode.com/) to get better at these style of questions, we chatted a bit more, and he thanked me and we parted ways.

I remember being puzzled afterward. Not at the fact that someone could have a sub-optimal answer to a coding question, but at the fact that this person didn't verify their answers afterward. If I was in their shoes, I would immediately be looking to see if I had done things right, scouring the internet for any resource that could help me understand where my answer landed on the optimality scale. Why did they not do the same thing?

I believe the root comes down to my experience here: I've failed at my fair share of things, from delivering a successful project at work to coding interviews. The countless failures have taught me two patterns I use constantly:

1. determine the success criteria for what you want to accomplish beforehand. Otherwise you have no idea whether you succeeded.
2. after you're done, check your work. Did

It's such a second-nature action for me to validate the work I've done, to have some metric of success, that I automatically assumed others would take the same tactic.

But therein lies the power of patterns: actions that are natural to me are the direct result of learning the same lesson, over and over again, until the behavior has become ingrained.

I think developing these patterns have been a large contributor to my success, and I highly suspect others as well.

Another example was working with an engineer on my team, who didn't understand why the work they depended on was not getting done by a partner engineering team. I asked if they validated
