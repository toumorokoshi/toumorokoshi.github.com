<p>For the holidays, my kids got a game called
<a href="https://gamewright.com/product/deduckto">Deduckto</a>. It’s a cute game for 8
years and older, where each player has their own mystery suspect which consists
of a suspect (like a pig), a disguise (a mustache), and a location (the
library). The goal of the game is to be able to identify all three attributes.</p>

<p>The game works by playing cards that are also a suspect, disguise, and location,
and putting each one into piles of “yes”, where there is one or more attributes
shared by a card, or “no” where none of the attributes are shared.</p>

<p>The game is meant for children and building their reasoning ability. And for my
kids, it’s been a great way for them to exercise that skill. I usually play more
cooperatively, where I talk with my kids about what the possibilities are, and
help them find relationships they didn’t before, like the fact that a card in
the “no” pile eliminates all of the attributes as possibilities.</p>

<p>So optimal play, I’m sure, won’t be the goal for most. That said: what is the
most optimal way to play? Here’s my thoughts.</p>
                <h2 id="tldr">   TLDR <a href="#tldr">#</a>   </h2>
                    

<p>Try to get as many pairs of cards that have a single common attribute in the
“yes” pile as possible. The strategy is:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If possible, play a card with only one common attribute with a single “yes”
card you already have.</li>
  <li>If you have no such card, play a card that shares nothing in common with any
of your yes or no cards, to find a new “yes” card. Between the two, prefer
yes (since something that matches cards you already have), then no.</li>
</ol>
                <h2 id="why">   Why <a href="#why">#</a>   </h2>
                    

<p>The optimal play is the one that eliminates the most possibilities.</p>

<p>Getting a “no” will at most eliminate three possiblities: a suspect, a disguise,
and a location.</p>

<p>Getting a “yes” can, at best, validate three attributes. But in most cases, it
will validate one. One way that is done by finding a pair of cards that are
disjoint in all but one attribute, but both are yes.</p>

<p>If you find a common attribute, you immediately eliminate all the other choices
for that feature. That means you can eliminate up to 6 other possibilities in a
single turn! Much more effective than eliminate 6 possibilities with 6 cards.</p>

<p>Getting a pair of yes cards would leave one of two possibilities:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The common attribute matches the secret suspect (e.g. they both are at the
“library”).</li>
  <li>The two cards match for a different reason, and each on a separate attribute
(e.g. for a (fox,bandana,library) and a (bear,mustache,library), fox and
mustache are matching or  bear and bandana are matching).</li>
</ol>

<p>Either could be validated by having a <em>third</em> matching card that shares
attributes with one or the other. And so on.</p>

<p>Among the cards, you will have the following, in order of preference to play.</p>

<ol>
  <li>card(s) that share 2 attributes, each with one or more yes cards, if the
attributes are not yet validated.</li>
  <li>card(s) that share 1 attribute with only one yes card, that does not already
share an attribute with another yes card.</li>
  <li>card(s) that share 1 attribute with two other yes cards.</li>
  <li>card(s) that share 0 attributes with any yes cards.</li>
  <li>all other cards.</li>
</ol>

<p>The reason is:</p>

<p>1: This will validate multiple attributes simultaneously. Although rare, it is
an ideal play.</p>

<p>2: A single attribute, common with a single yes card, will help identify a
unique attribute of your suspect.</p>

<p>3: This will help confirm that the attribute shared by the other 2 cards is
indeed the card that is unique to the suspect.</p>

<p>3: The above work to validate attributes your suspect may have. But if you can’t
do that, then it’s best to find new “yes” cards. The best way to do that is to
play unique cards as much as possible, disjoint to “yes”es, but ideally also
“no”s as well.</p>

<p>Anything else is effectively useless, giving no information.</p>
