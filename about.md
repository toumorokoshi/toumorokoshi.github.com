# About Yusuke Tsutsumi

I am a software engineer, mainly interested in back-end and open source tool development. I graduated from the University of Washington in December 2011 with degrees in Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, and Physics.

I wrote my first application in 2008, an address book written in perl.

Please refer to my [Github profile](https://github.com/toumorokoshi?tab=repositories) for a (mostly) full history of my open source projects.
