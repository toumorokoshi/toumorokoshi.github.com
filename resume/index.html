<p>I worked on Google Cloud for my entire tenure, primarily working in the area of
Infrastructure-as-code tools including Kubernetes (Config Connector), Terraform,
Pulumi, and Ansible. I was primarily focused on resource coverage and
declarative usability: how integrations with GCP APIs could enable a better
declarative user experience.</p>

<p>That lead to an effort to enable better API practices and integrations into more
than just declarative clients, including UIs, Command Lines and loosely typed
clients.</p>

<p>I drove a multi-year, cross-organization, cross-functional project spanning 9
development teams to significantly improve the usability and reduce the cost of
these integrations. As a result of my work I was given the role of API Design
tech lead at Google (although my work continued to primary be about GCP).</p>

<p>As an engineering manager, I lead a team of 3 teams, spanning 15 SWEs and 3+
contractors supporting the declarative use cases of GCP’s biggest
customers.</p>

<h3 id="zillow">Zillow</h3>

<p>From 2011-06 to 2020-07, I worked at Zillow, starting as an intern on the build
infrastructure team. I proposed, designed, and implemented many of the core
architectural decisions of how Zillow used Python. I left as a senior manager of
engineering velocity, managing a team of teams with 15 SWEs who owned the
logging, monitoring, distributed tracing, and integration testing platform used
by all of Zillow.com and other acquisitions.</p>

<p>A brief list of achievements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I was a de-facto Python architect, developing the scaffolding tools for
creating projects, build system improvements, proposing and implementing the
standard web frameworks used. One of my biggest achievements in transitioning
Zillow to a primary asyncio based ecosystem, reducing long-tail latency by 10x
as well as improving webservice throughput by 10x relative to the previous
multi-threaded services.</li>
  <li>I built several of the build and deployment tooling, including CI/CD
scaffolding that enabled on-demand database schema updates for test
environments, no-outage deployments via careful ordering of load balancer
enrollment and apache instance turnup.</li>
  <li>As the manager of the observability team, I grew the team from a single
engineer to multiple sub-teams and 12 engineers across Seattle and Pune,
India. We owned the infrastructure for distributed tracing, logging, metric
storage, and integration testing. During this time I was a maintainer for the
Python OpenTelemetry clients.</li>
  <li>I drove the migration from Python 2 to Python 3, organizing help sessions and
fostering a support community, working with TPM to track milestones, and
helping with deeper technical issues as the need arose. Migration was
accomplished with minor delays (1 month due to some outliers who need
exceptions relative to business goals).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="extended">Extended</h2>

<h3 id="2022">2022</h3>

<ul>
  <li>I was a <a href="https://github.com/ansible-collections/google.cloud">maintainer of the google.cloud Ansible
repository</a>. I
rehabilitated the project from no testing to one with full CI, fixed 80+
integration tests, and added maintainer documentation.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="project-highlights">Project Highlights</h2>

<h3 id="opentelemetry">OpenTelemetry</h3>

<p>Years: 2019-2020</p>

<p>I was the maintainer of the opentelemetry python client, a CNCF project
dedicated to telemetry SDKs for distributed traces and metrics. I drove the
Python SDK from alpha status to beta. The project now has <a href="https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python">over 1300 GitHub
stars</a>.</p>

<p>I helped onboard new contributors, ran steering meetings, reviewed
code to drive the architectural direction, and contributed code directly to
areas including metrics and context propagation.</p>

<h3 id="cerebrawl">Cerebrawl</h3>

<p>Years: 2015
Technologies: Unity, C#</p>

<p>I was the main developer for http://cerebrawl.in/, an indie fighting game. I worked closely with our team including an artist, composer, producer, and other developers.</p>

<p>Features included a flexible component entity system, deterministic physics engine, and flexible GUI-based state machine editor. With my work, the game made it to a successful demo that was shared via itch.io.</p>

<h3 id="langverse">Langverse</h3>

<p>Years: 2016 (current)
Technologies: Python, Docker, AWS ECS then Kubernetes, Terraform, Postgres, NLP</p>

<p>I have a passion for learning languages, and wanted to build a website that
would help me learn them.</p>

<p>I Created a single page web application for language learning
(https://www.langverse.com/). Utilized natural language processing and
generation techniques for dynamic creation of flash cards from one language to
another. Authored a NL generation library: http://nlgen.readthedocs.io/</p>
