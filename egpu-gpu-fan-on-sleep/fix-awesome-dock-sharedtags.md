For my desktop environment, I use [awesomewm]() to managed my windows, along with some extensions like [shared-tags](https://github.com/Drauthius/awesome-sharedtags).

I've had a prevaling issue where whenever I connect to a dock, my connected screen ends up only showing a tiled tag that doesn't share my common tags.
